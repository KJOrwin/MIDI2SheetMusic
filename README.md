# MIDI2SheetMusic
This project is my NEA A-level project where I will be making a MIDI to sheet music converter.
The final realese should be able to take a midi file as an input and ouput the sheet music as either a pdf, png or svg.
This is done by converting the bytes of the MIDI file to LilyPond and using its parser to create sheet music.
